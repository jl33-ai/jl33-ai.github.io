# Why Streamlit?

- No one, in the history of human civilization, has ever said: "boy, this app is so helpful, but I don't like it cos it's written in X"
- I can respond to feature requests in ~30 minutes instead of 3 hours.
- Free hosting, because hobbies should stay hobbies.
- [Be a Jedi master, not a mid-wit](https://youtu.be/rP7bpYsfa6Q?si=NdXIYPDYvKCaqfq2&t=989).
