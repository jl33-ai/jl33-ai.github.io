I made an open source University grade calculator that ranks #1 on Google.

# My learnings


1. Someone else will have already thought of your idea

2. Someone will point out why it's pointless

3. But at the end of the day... _‍_

# The numbers 

Almost 7 months later (after completely forgetting about the project) I decided to check the analytics

To my surprise, not only was the app still active, it had been used dozens of times in the **last hour**.

# ⚐ Why did I build it with `Streamlit`?

- TLDR: Because the users don't care.
- Complex engineering is beautiful, but it has its place.
- I can add new feature requests in ~30 mins instead of 3 hours.
- Free, automatic hosting.
