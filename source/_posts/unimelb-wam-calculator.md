**I built an** open source University grade calculator that ranks #1 on Google.

It just _works_, and has some nerdy stuff (stats and OCR) for those who want it

##### Features
- Autofill from screenshot 
- Infer grades needed for future WAM 
- Statistics and analytics
- Exam weighting calculator

# My takeaways


1. Someone else will have already thought of your idea

2. Someone will point out why it's pointless

3. But at the end of the day...¬†_‚Äç_

_Someone makes it all worth it._

# Analytics 

Almost 7 months later, I check, on a random Tuesday night...

# ‚öê Why did I build it with `Streamlit`?

TL,DR: Because the end-users don't care. 

Complicated engineering is beautiful, but it has its place. The goal of this webapp was to reach (and help) **_as many people as possible_**, in as short amount of time as possible. 

**Every month or so** a new feature request pops up in the Reddit thread from some wishful university student. 

With `Streamlit` this usually means a few lines of code (maybe a few more lines of refactoring.) 

And 'deploying' with `Streamlit` - yeah, don't worry, it's covered. No blue whale required from your end üê≥. 

This is a **common pattern** in the space of engineers who want to build things that other people use: [be a Jedi master, not a mid-wit](https://youtu.be/rP7bpYsfa6Q?si=NdXIYPDYvKCaqfq2&t=989).

Other benefits include:
1. Free hosting
2. Built-in analytics
3. Python-native (like all the data visualisation libraries you always want to use)
4. `css`-less (CSS, I love you, but not right now)
