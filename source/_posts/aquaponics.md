My first engineering project wasn't a program, it was a fish tank. 

**Here is the idea behind aquaponics:** 
1. The fish sh*t in the water, which fertilizes it for the plants
2. The plants keep the water clean for the fish

A perfect system, perfection in its simplicity. Perfectly self-sustaining, enclosed, and symbiotic. 

It fascinated my mind. I begged my parents to take me to [Bunnings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunnings). 
Nothing would stop me from building my **aquaponics system**.
