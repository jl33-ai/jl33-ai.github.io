The history of technology is earmarked by the invention of new interfaces. Interfaces are born when we realize that there is a new type of _consumer_ that wants to read or write to our systems.

<br>

# Examples

For example, the Application Programming Interface (API) was born because software needed a way to communicate with other software and programmers. So we started writing specifications like [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST).

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) was made in [Xerox PARC](https://spectrum.ieee.org/xerox-parc) because we needed to make computers accessible to _normal people_ (not just programmers). So we moved from text-based commands to visual metaphors (like the mouse, desktop, or folders).

When you apply this framework, all breakthroughs in technology seem obvious. All they were doing was catering to a new type of consumer.

A recent example is [Search Engine Optimization](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide). SEO was born thanks to a new type of consumer: the [web crawler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler). People understood that their webpages were no longer being read by just humans, so they started writing html to be read by crawlers too.

# How to create interfaces

The Act of Interface Creation is a simple **two-step process**:
1. Identify that there is a new type of consumer who wants to read/write to your stuff.
2. Consider how to design your interface so that it is as "readable" as possible for the consumer.

# AgentWare

There's a new consumer on the block: the **[AI agent](https://zapier.com/blog/ai-agent/)**. 

All content we create will eventually be read by an agent. We must redesign with this in mind. [Hypermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia) was at first _computer-readable_, then _human-readable_, and then _web-scraper-readable_. Now it must be _agent-readable_.

I propose **_AgentWare_** â€” applications built from the ground-up for agents as the end-user. 

**_AgentWare_** will have underlying data structures that can be easily read by agents, and written to if needed. 

Because the way humans and agents "read" is quite similar, **_AgentWare_** will be backwards-compatible with existing software for a while, and therefore maintain good "user-interface" for human beings.

# Conclusion

Interfaces are just anything that enable any _A_ to connect with _B_. Without interfaces, things exist in complete isolation. With well-made interfaces, there is infinite emergent potential.
