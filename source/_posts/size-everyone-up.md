Why and how to size everybody up.

Scrutiny should not include judgment.  
Inspection should not include perversion.

what is attention? commetning on someone's new piece of clothing, or haircut. 
But attention is transactional
Attention is a social currency. And just like real money, people are often so hyperfixated on the pursuit of amassing more of it, that they forget to be generous with it.
Attention is literally to be 'paid' - we start our day with a finite amount to be dispensed, and yet are consumed only by the pursuit of accumulating more of it


In a sense, the world lacks attention liquidity. No economy made up of only people willing to sell will be healthy [1]

Attention doesn’t have to be a 0-sum game; if everyone made an intentional effort to (appreciate?) other people more, the net level of attention received by any given person at any given time would increase.

self”. Paying attention to others in a non-judgemental way is not reductive. It will teach you more about yourself than

Ask Claude to add cool words

How to do it? It's pretty simple - just deploy empathy
- 6 senses
- everything someone is presenting was an intentional choice - either for the notice of others, or simply for one's own satisfaction
