- [ ] Haskell, => and mathematics, and philosophy [wip]
In javascript, w/o side effects, => actually means implies
- (>”The sun has risen every morning for the last 1000 years”) => >”It will rise tomorrow”
- Semantic compiler
- Closure. I really like the name closure. It may be like but closure, a functional programming language for philosophy. 
- a deterministic adapter and a functional (deterministic) compiler to merely check the validity (w/ truth tables)

Primitives:
Doing promise => !conclusion should evaluate to 'impossible'
