<p>t’s a positive feedback loop and I observe it: you grind, get blessings beyond your wildest imaginations, feel guilt, keep grinding because you eschew the enjoyment of life because how could you possibly deserve the privilege you have. </p>
<p>I believe in fucking absurd level of proactivity and unreasonable over preparedness</p>
<p>Expand your brain in as many dimensions as possible. </p>
<p>Be relentless in this pursuit; you will need to go against the grain, and it will feel unnatural and draining. [link to serendipity, compound social circle, surround yourself with…)</p>
<p>I learnt from Linus: I have no problem being pushy and hard if it makes them better and happier and gets them out the butcher</p>
<p>Extremity is often realised in the form of extreme plainness, stillness, and silence.</p>
<p>It can seem mundane and boring at a shallow assessment</p>
<p>But I often use the analogy of an espresso - obsensibly the most plain - boring - order one can get. And yet one which leads to the most intense high - the greatest abundance. Because you strip away the ‘fat’ - the accessories, the milk. Sure, those accessories and additives lead to more cohesive flavours; it just depends what you want from life </p>
<p>eschew  </p>

<p>Shift your perspective.</p>
<p>Eat plain food - milk and oats, beans and broccoli - quote Seneca. &amp;&amp; if it’s hard, start praying before meals. It’s a good psychological hack. </p>
<p>Being unfeeling does not equal being uncaring. We just have to become unfeeling in order to endure. By enduring we can continue to lead. </p>

<p>Some like to employ a kind of mental weaponry. Highly weaponized kernels of thought which alone are substantive enough to induce worldly movements.</p>
<p>For example: the Daniel guy: “your competition is…” </p>
<p>There’s another one I like… ?</p>
<p>I propose an alternative: recall the most testing thing that you endured. How dare you disrespect the version of yourself who endured that thing. E.g the 4 months or 4 cold lonely laps of Albert park. You should be able to easily put yourself back in the shoes of that person - it was simply an earlier version of you. Imagine how they would feel seeing you be lazy/ungrateful in this present moment. In short, contextualize your current laziness with what your past self has endured in order to bring you to the current moment. Imagine how you would feel seeing you abuse this present moment by being lazy/emitting trivial complaint. Is your clumsy lethargy a symptom of disrespect for your past self? Disrespect in general should be avoided at all costs, especially to one’s own past self. Is it unappreciative, neglectful. Is it out of touch with what you have endured to get here? ingrateful. </p>

<p>You can always cleverly twist or reframe things: sliding window of gratitude. Seneca: page 67.</p>
<p>These mental shifts can be unnaturally effective. </p>
<p>Another one is empathizing rather than judging. No, you shouldn’t contort your view into one of patronisation. </p>
<p>Life is about inventory. building up the skills, tools, network, necessary to impart the change you desire on the world around you. That’s why I love starting out as an engineer. </p>
<p>Life is about building up the optimal perfect-for-you framework for the self. </p>
<p>And then knowing when to ignore it for morals. </p>
<p>True Kind Grind is knowing when to override the self framework. </p>
<p>I see incredibke fucking beauty in abstinence and consistency</p>
<p>If you have sold your soul to be ‘locked in’, hedging everything on the day you make it and can reclaim it, you have fundamentally failed. </p>
<p>We are defined by who we are in our darkest hour.</p>
<p>You can hold a lot of conflicting ideas at once sometimes.</p>

<p>Find beauty in the abyss, in the grey</p>
<p>It is the only way. </p>
<p>All pain is followed by beauty, which you cannot yet comprehend. </p>
<p>Master your emotions and hormones. You will find yourself standing with perfect posture, thinking but not ruminating. Meditating without calculating. Just like crying - about the most pure things. And you feel so good and so alive. </p>
<p>Those winter weekends, back to back to back. </p>
<p>God had me - reassuring me with blankets of rain that gave everything this feweling of: it’s okay to be here. </p>

<p>Prjcts aren’t a waste of time. They’re so fulfilling and most important meditative. </p>

<p>Diet</p>
<p>It’s not a diet ≠ in the most fundamental sense - we are evertything that we eat</p>
<p>It’s more holistic than that. I just can’t justify it. </p>
<p>We become everything that we consume - books, sunlight, exercise, ESPECIALLY, directly and biologically, what we eat. </p>
<p>We are but a function of all of our inputs - </p>
<p>You can easily define and engineer yourself simply controlling your inputs - your body and brain handles the rest of the complexity</p>
<p>Me vs. 2 years ago. I only have regret. I’d wake at 10:10, so tired.</p>

<p>This is why I defend my mental peace so carefully m</p>
<p>On discipline: </p>
<p>⁃ Most people are only disciplined when they are happy. </p>
<p>⁃ There is nothing more self-actuating (and differentiating) than being disciplined when you are unhappy</p>
<p>Self assured ness is transcendental</p>
<p>Bruise your body, batter your mind </p>
<p>I learnt my final lesson: do not talk shit, or be expecting. Like just don’t talk shit; Izzy, etc. drama is bad. Real people suffer. Never ever derive joy from gossiping about someone else’s misfortune, even if you believe that person may deserve it. </p>
<p>Cache your happiness like Money. Extend definition of stoicism. </p>
<p>Pseudo stoicism- cos it’s easier when you’re enduring happiness</p>
<p>The key is to learn to feel sorry for yourself less, on that 5am jog. It makes you more likely to do it again tomorrow </p>
<p>We are almost completely definEd by our consistency. To anyone beyond your IG followers who you know better by handle, you are the habits you’ve always had, not the new hobby you just found</p>
<p>Stoicism is not the same as being impartial over everything, cos that would be disingenuous. </p>
<p>Be stoic but in a DTE taking the piss way, not a harass way</p>
<p>I would extend the definition of stoicism: </p>
<p>⁃ To endure happiness without showing emotion or elating. there is nothing to celebrate</p>
<p>Pretty simple quote that you should let lead your life: </p>
<p>⁃ Integrity is what you do when no one’s watching</p>
<p>• Aristotle once said, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”</p>
<p>Stoicism: </p>
<p>⁃ Athens, 3rd century BC - founded. </p>
<p>⁃ Seneca, letters from a stoic - we suffer more often in imagination than reality. </p>
<p>⁃ being more tolerant of others and more critical of yourself  - Tolerance is not trust. </p>
<p>⁃ enduring pain and hardship without showing one’s emotions or complaining. </p>
<p>⁃ Marcus Auraleius meditations: be tolerant of others and strict with yourself - invert</p>
<p>◦ Normally we confound the attributes of a stoic with that of an arrogant, ego full person. Meeting them irl (max C, Linus L) - you begin to respect them even more than if you had succumbed to the image you mistakenly assumed they were projecting. When viewed externally and from great distance, stoicism is nearly indistinguishable from ego/arrogance</p>

<p>Thing you can’t get in exchange for monry. </p>

<p>We are defined by our habits when we have absolutely nothing to look forward to </p>
<p>Concise </p>
<p>A stranger entering your home should admire you not your fuetnjture </p>
<p>Always gotta clear the table</p>
<p>Handsome waiter? Nah just intgeiry + confidence. 🫴, cmon, u finishe?</p>
<p>Open mindedness can be bad. But you have to be open minded before you’re close minded. Otherwise you’ll bottleneck before the funnel</p>
<p>One needn’t fully confound forgivingness with strong principles. </p>
<p>Forgivingness is a reactive act, while principles should be preemptive and preparatory acts.</p>
<p>It should be “it’s okay that you made that mistake, but next time you should do this.”</p>
<p>Strictness is a reactive act, a slap on the wrist for making a mistake. </p>
<p>Success is not built on success. It’s built on failure, It’s built on fraustration. it’s built on fear that you have to overcome.</p>
<p>Having an outlet is a point of weakness. But yku must have one - so pick wisely, something which your access to is least likely to ever be severed or restricted; e.g, reading a book. Exercise. Things which you are always.</p>
<p>And then, THE SECRET, the single most important way to increase your own extremity - surround yourself with others more extreme. </p>
<p>At first this sounds 1. Unnatural 2. Uncomfortablez Trust me, it will work automatically, with 0 extra effort from you. We have powerful mimetic systems. You simply have to hijack these systems it will do the work for you. The next extreme thing will not require as much mental negotiation - you will just decide to do it. </p>
<p>Doing hard things gives you new vaselines to push off of </p>
<p>A sad truth about the world is that people care more about buying cologne than showering. </p>
<p>Craft</p>
<p>I think I love screenwriting and movieproduction (although I hate watchgint hem) because it’s such a pure form of expression of vision as craft. Colloquially it’s the product of one very talented and dogged person being like ‘aight bet, let me cook then, fucking watch this’. And then just cooking and making something that just goes so insanely hard. </p>

<p>I hate when you share things with someone and they assume that they either need to take a binary stance on it (either fully agree or disagree) - completely ignoring the existence of that middle ground of possibility inbetween. Like no I just want you to say that’s interesting </p>
<p>Or they prescribe advice rather than attention. </p>
<p>Life is suffering. </p>
<p>suffering ends with attachment to desire. People somehow assume that to give up desire is to give up in general. And so it has this ‘defeated’ tinge to it. No. If you desire the yatch. Keep grinding. Just channel all your energy into the grind itself not your desire for the outcome. That’s how the best I know do it. It’s the only way to do it - because when things get tough, and they will, </p>
<p>Everyone is always searching for the because. </p>

<p>It ceases to be hard or monotonous or painful. Honestly, the more bland the better, because it feels more important - like paperwork - and so you’re impelled to get it done, it pains you to leave it unfinished, it satiates you to be working on it, and it satisfies you when done. </p>
<p>There are certain muscles to be trained - which no one ever tells you to train </p>
<p>⁃ The muscle of biting your tongue </p>
<p>⁃ The muscle of being able to walk into a shop without the urge that you need to come out having bought something</p>
<p>You have to be religious about not falling behind - or even better, stay ahead. It sounds weird but it helps to streamline your life in order to do this. Ruthlessly simplify your life. You want all the action to be happening within you not around you. One who enters your home should admire you not your furtnute. It is easier to get addicted to one thing. </p>

<p>Of course there’s things I’m sacrificing. Real thing. There are much better things that I could be doing.

<p>⁃ There can be no such thing as on the grind or off the grind. just like in certain cultures, certain concepts to not even exist - then you cannot be vulnerable to their absence. Does that make sense. The farmer never yearns for ice cream cos he doesn’t know what it is. You can’t yearn for something which you cannot com[rehend. </p>
<p>If you’re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don’t even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery—isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you’ll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you’re going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It’s the only good fight there is.”</p>
