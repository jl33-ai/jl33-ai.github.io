It’s to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.\n\n\n“Because I didn’t pay attention to users. I invented a model of the world that didn’t correspond to reality, and worked from that.”\n\n\nWhy do so many founders build things no one wants? Because they begin by trying to think of startup ideas. That m.o. is doubly dangerous: it doesn’t merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them.\n\n\nSitcom ideas - forced ideas written into existence\n\n\nThe danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your friends with pets, they don’t say “I would never use this.” They say “Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that.” Even when the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people. They don’t want to use it themselves, at least not right now, but they could imagine other people wanting it. Sum that reaction across the entire population, and you have zero users.\n\n\nWhen you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? Who wants this so much that they’ll use it even when it’s a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they’ve never heard of? If you can’t answer that, the idea is probably bad.\n\n\nColleges are similar enough that if you build a facebook that works at Harvard, it will work at any college. So you spread rapidly through all the colleges. Once you have all the college students, you get everyone else simply by letting them in.\n\n\nThey didn’t foresee the expansion of this idea; it forced itself upon them gradually.\n\n\nLive in the future, then build what’s missing.\n\n\nThe verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not “think up” but “notice.” At YC we call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders’ own experiences “organic” startup ideas. The most successful startups almost all begin this way\n\n\nIf you’re not at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you can get to one. For example, anyone reasonably smart can probably get to an edge of programming (e.g. building mobile apps) in a year. Since a successful startup will consume at least 3-5 years of your life, a year’s preparation would be a reasonable investment. Especially if you’re also looking for a cofounder.\n\n\nKnowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you’ll be able to implement them. That’s not absolutely necessary (Jeff Bezos couldn’t) but it’s an advantage. It’s a big advantage, when you’re considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if instead of merely thinking “That’s an interesting idea,” you can think instead “That’s an interesting idea. I’ll try building an initial version tonight.” It’s even better when you’re both a programmer and the target user, because then the cycle of generating new versions and testing them on users can happen inside one head.\n\n\nBut you know the ideas are out there. This is not one of those problems where there might not be an answer. It’s impossibly unlikely that this is the exact moment when technological progress stops. You can be sure people are going to build things in the next few years that will make you think “What did I do before x?”\n\n\nWhat did I do before x?\n\n\nAnd when these problems get solved, they will probably seem flamingly obvious in retrospect. What you need to do is turn off the filters that usually prevent you from seeing them. The most powerful is simply taking the current state of the world for granted. Even the most radically open-minded of us mostly do that. You couldn’t get from your bed to the front door if you stopped to question everything.\n\n\nLive in the future and build what seems interesting.\n\n\nAll you’ll learn is the words for things.\n\n\nThe clash of domains is a particularly fruitful source of ideas. If you know a lot about programming and you start learning about some other field, you’ll probably see problems that software could solve. In fact, you’re doubly likely to find good problems in another domain: (a) the inhabitants of that domain are not as likely as software people to have already solved their problems with software, and (b) since you come into the new domain totally ignorant, you don’t even know what the status quo is to take it for granted.\n\n\nSo if you’re a CS major and you want to start a startup, instead of taking a class on entrepreneurship you’re better off taking a class on, say, genetics. Or better still, go work for a biotech company. CS majors normally get summer jobs at computer hardware or software companies. But if you want to find startup ideas, you might do better to get a summer job in some unrelated field.\n\n\nBecause a good idea should seem obvious, when you have one you’ll tend to feel that you’re late. Don’t let that deter you. Worrying that you’re late is one of the signs of a good idea. Ten minutes of searching the web will usually settle the question. Even if you find someone else working on the same thing, you’re probably not too late. It’s exceptionally rare for startups to be killed by competitors — so rare that you can almost discount the possibility. So unless you discover a competitor with the sort of lock-in that would prevent users from choosing you, don’t discard the idea.\n\n\n Your thesis has to be more precise than “we’re going to make an x that doesn’t suck” though. You have to be able to phrase it in terms of something the incumbents are overlooking. Best of all is when you can say that they didn’t have the courage of their convictions, and that your plan is what they’d have done if they’d followed through on their own insights.\n\n\nIf you’re at the leading edge of a field that’s changing rapidly, your ideas about what’s sexy will be somewhat correlated with what’s valuable in practice.\n\n\nSo if you’re a young founder (under 23 say), are there things you and your friends would like to do that current technology won’t let you?\n\n\nOne way to ensure you do a good job solving other people’s problems is to make them your own. When Rajat Suri of E la Carte decided to write software for restaurants, he got a job as a waiter to learn how restaurants worked. That may seem like taking things to extremes, but startups are extreme. We love it when founders do such things.\n\n\nA good trick for bypassing the schlep and to some extent the unsexy filter is to ask what you wish someone else would build, so that you could use it. What would you pay for right now?\n\n\nBut imagine asking that in)) the future, not now. When one company or industry replaces another, it usually comes in from the side. So don’t look for a replacement for x; look for something that people will later say turned out to be a replacement for x. And be imaginative about the axis along which the replacement occurs. Traditional journalism, for example, is a way for readers to get information and to kill time, a way for writers to make money and to get attention, and a vehicle for several different types of advertising. It could be replaced on any of these axes (it has already started to be on most).\n\n\nLive in the future and build what seems interesting.\n\n\nIn Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig says:\n\n\nYou want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It’s easy. Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally.\n\n\nIt’s easier to invent the future than predict it - Alan AKay\ncreate dont consume\n\n"},"p/20":{"title":"20","links":["p/Reading"],"tags":[],"content":"Every story has two versions. \nfirst, the version you’ve already experienced.

Some things are beautiful because… they just are. [Image]\nAn alternative definition is the following: if there was some hypothetical god-like creature with the ability to alter evolutionary history, would it be possible to change history in such a way as to make something previously beautiful no longer so? \nTake a classic example: symmetrical faces. We find symmetrical faces beautiful because our brains are wired to associate facial symmetry with genetic health and reproductive fitness. But what if evolution was rewritten - \nGiven enough time, would the original beauty endure? Given time, intrinsic beauty should be re-recognized, because it is independent to any environmental variable, and because it need not perform any function to be perceived. It simply ‘is’ beautiful. \nIf one were to assume that such beauty could not exist, then it would follow that intrinsic beauty is a placeholder - one which we assign in the interim - until we develop the science and philosophy necessary to explicate it as functional beauty. \nIntrinsic beauty is a name we’ve invented to describe things that we cannot explain why we love yet. \nIntrinsic beauty is a name for that which we cannot understand why we love - what is more scary. \nIntrinsically beautiful is a name for that which we do not yet understand why we love. \nIt’s not possible to tell someone that a song doesn’t sound good anymore. But it is functional. \n“We find music beautiful because it activates the brain’s reward centers, releasing dopamine and other neurotransmitters associated with pleasure and emotional response.”\nOne of my tests is if you change the history of evolution, would the present day species still find it beautiful. As a corollary, if you substituted humankind for a different species, would our definition of beauty change. \nAt the start of this article I said bohek was intrinsically beautiful. But maybe it isn’t. I recall standing on the laminated floor of my high school biology lab as my teacher, Mr G., explained why we mammals have an inclination for height. \nI had yet to hit my growth spurt.

But they are.  \nThey are rooted in our neurological heritage. \nIt also requires first confessing to how thin our attractions/desires truly are - a lot of the time, we construct layers of complexity in an attempt to make this seem less the case. But it is okay: we are slightly smarter monkeys. \nWe often elevate ‘beauty’ to this , because of the thickness of emotion that often accompanies it. As if the experience of beauty is some sacrosanct part of the human experience, which would be anti-human to attempt to decode. \nTo refactor the perception of beauty into that of mere utility seems like an ugly, uninspiring demotion. Moreover, formularizing one’s attraction on one’s behalf seems intrusive and arrogant. \nShould we find it disillusioning that many of our most guttural desires are all functional? Should knowing the fundamental reasoning behind our most intrinsic desires necessarily nullify them? \nNot really. Science and poetry need not contradict each other.\nLet’s say the world’s most well-read biologist may be able to articulate the exact explanation for everything - love, sex, even our desires for money.

We know by inverse study of the neural network that we approximate it (use the pic from hands on ML) - which requires many less neutrons. In fact, this differential equation for the throwing of a ball can literally be approximated pretty well with only X neurons. And well, I’m no neuroscientist, but we have way more than that. And that’s assuming that our brains are no more complex than a traditional MLP neural network (which in an of itself is a simplifying model of the true neural networks in the brain) (show side by side)\nIn this way - monger is right. since we are neural networks, we by definition perform gradient descent, with an objective function of survival (and reproduction). \nThis happens on the lifetime scale: our decisions are shaped by little gradient descent iterations\nIt also happens on the evolutionary scale, as monger points out. \nSo, no - we don’t know the _____. [Insert something from Machine learning, that part about the models that generate weaving patterns]. But what is cool the human brain is the only device that both approximated something and was able to decode the bottommost truth about the thing it was approximating. \nIn a way, we a machine slowly making itself redundant by discovering its own programming. We are essentially refactoring ourselves and turning those guessing, stochastic parts into deterministic parts. Just as we were once able to throw spears, and then later, decode the explicit rules underlying the gravity of thrown object. Now, humans think. But on ce we find the source code underlying intelligence, who is it say we can’t synthesise it to our liking - this is my argument for the singularity. \nAnd yet we still approximate it. If you lobbed a tennis ball at The greatest mathematician in the world doesn’t actually perform those computations in his/her head in order to catch it.

I’ll explain each one:\n\n\n“If It Ain’t Broke, Don’t Fix It”: This advises against making unnecessary changes to working code. It suggests focusing on fixing actual issues rather than modifying functional parts.\n\n\n“Keep it DRY”: DRY stands for “Don’t Repeat Yourself”. This principle encourages code reusability and avoiding duplication to improve maintainability.\n\n\n“Separation of Concerns”: This principle advocates for dividing a program into distinct sections, each addressing a separate concern. It promotes modularity and easier maintenance.\n\n\n“You Aren’t Gonna Need It” (YAGNI): This principle suggests not adding functionality until it’s necessary, to avoid overengineering and wasted effort.\n\n\n“Keep it Simple, Stupid” (KISS): This emphasizes the importance of simplicity in design. Simple solutions are often more maintainable and less error-prone.\n\n\n“Arrange, Act, Assert”: This refers to the structure of unit tests, organizing them into setup, action, and verification phases.\n\n\n“Worse is Better”: This controversial concept suggests that a simpler, even if imperfect, solution can be more practical and successful than a complex, theoretically superior one.\n\n\n“Avoid Premature [CENSORED]”: The full phrase is likely “Avoid Premature Optimization”. It cautions against optimizing code too early in the development process, as it can lead to unnecessary complexity.\n\n\n\nSingle Responsibility Principle: Each module or class should have one, and only one, reason to change.\nOpen/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\nLiskov Substitution Principle: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.\nInterface Segregation Principle: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.\nDependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not concretions. High-level modules shouldn’t depend on low-level modules.\nComposition Over Inheritance: Favor object composition over class inheritance when designing solutions.\nSOLID: An acronym for the first five principles listed above, promoting more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software.\nDon’t Repeat Yourself (DRY): Avoid duplicating code by abstracting common things into one place.\nYAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It): Don’t implement functionality until it’s necessary.\nLaw of Demeter: A unit should have limited knowledge about other units and only talk to its immediate friends.\nEncapsulation: Bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit.\nAbstraction: Hiding complex implementation details behind a simpler interface.\nPolymorphism: Ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.\nInheritance: Mechanism where a new class is derived from an existing class.\nFail Fast: Systems should immediately report failures rather than trying to proceed with uncertain or incomplete data.\n"},"s/The-second-best-time-to-stare-at-a-tree":{"title":"The second best time to stare at a tree","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Write a longer write up on ‘things I learnt from staring at a tree for an hour’\nKnow thyself.

There is some sphere beyond which those things cease to matter. Transcend it. ask yourself, truly, what binds you to those problems. If they are not greater than your self\n\n\nAudrey - she was onto something, with boredom. \n\n\nWe spend most of our time letting our thoughts giving us anxiety. Try not to think about anything stressing you out; just on the tree. A good fallback is just continuing to notice the tee - trust me you can, I tried. Think about how you would sketch it if you had to. (Calculating) Naturally; if not thinking about what you do not have, you’ll start thinking about what you do have\n\n\nWork will stress you out less; because you have persepctiveW\n\n\nThe rain, the sun, the kangaroos. I Know. \n\n\nWhat’s a good framework? it’s not about thinking about nothing and freezing your mind. It’s about switching modes; whatever circuitry to keep on, whatever neural pathways loop to keep your eyelids open; let them happen. \n\n\nNo joke; the fucking kangaroos. I realised that they were natural too. \n\n\nSet clear guidelines: composing  (writing essays, music) can be either - reflection mostly isn’t (recalling a chapter from your most recent fiction novel) \n\n\nI realised why I didn’t like travelling - I simply wasn’t secure enough in what I’ve achieved to allow myself to fulfil the thick desire of seeing the world and exploring nature. This is when I realised thick desires are sequential. \n\n\nYou shouldn’t be intentionally calculating. But you might go 10 years without ever unpacking something; you’ll just live with it, accept it as it is. Like a spot on the wall you walk past every day without cleaning, and then \n\n\nYou’ll most likely find that you do a LOT of calculating thought. Don’t try imitate those who have that as their edge. A Bentley would never compete with a F1 car. \n\n\nThoughts - I’m not _ enough, I didn’t start _ too enough - or - it’s too late to start _. \n\n\nGoals are healthy - they apply an upward pressure to your life - without them, life ceases to exist. But with goals, comes _. This can lead the ambitious to much distress. The second best time to stare at a tree is now. \n\n\nThis is a lot to put on the internet - let alone the blockchain. \n\n\nMy whole life has been mimetic. Unfortunately; I had enough aptitude that it just worked, and I never had to second guess whether what I was doing was right. Drums → school captain. He sat me down and told me that I had to pick between school captain and leaving band. I thought of my English teacher. I picked leaving band.* (* they didn’t take it away - the first bluff). I dux’ed my school with a perfect ATAR and got a perfect score on the GAT (SAT’s). \n\n\nBut this seems too good to be true. If doing nothing is so beneficial, why doesn’t everyone do it? Well here’s the thing; we don’t. \n\n\nAnd for the type who thinks they’ve got to cram every second of their precious free time with that article on their phone… realising that staring into the void while they brush their teeth, unhooking their mind, can be just as good. \n\n\n1-video. Ya promised. \n\n\ntrust me do it. Youll react more slowly. Yoll read lonher\n\n\nEvery time I do it I pan deeper into my own past. \nWe tend to move with such a shallow sliding window \nAs if we have only existed for the past 5 years \nThat far-sighted retrospection can be extremely valuable.\nMost of all: to spend less time worrying about what we don’t have (it’s unproductive and self destructive, autocatalysis, self reinforcinng) - and more time reliving the glory of what we do. \nHow do you know you’re in the right state? It should feel like a kind of drunk - painful drunk (explain why)\nwe all have that one sufficient nerdy person in our lives who begs the importance of turning off our computers. \nAt any given moment we are running so many ( ) - making plans, making mental reminders of plan. - these all need to be short circuited. You’re doing it right if you don’t feel\nYour only goal is to have no goals. No calculating thoughts It’s different to thinking about nothing.  \nThe only real test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life - Naval. \nIf you think this is a waste of time you lack a fundamental understanding. \nWe spend 8 hours sleeping\nWe spend 1 hour reading the news because we think staying up to date is good \nWe __\\  \nWe’ll think ourselves to burnout if it means making more $, impressing the right person. \nYou won’t spend an hour thinking about what you really want out of life? It might save you months, or decades. \nYou probably never realised \nPeople in movies do one thing that we never do, and subconsciously recognise as ‘cool’ - they do nothing while they think\nLie on the floor Stare at the ceiljng, listen to music. \nYou did it when you were young. And without realising it probably had some of your most important thoughts. \nAnecdote: \nCoding is meditation. How did it help me choose my career path. By being extremely self-attentive, I realised that there were only two times I was able to enter a completely natural flow state: when practicing piano, or when writing code. For others, this is doing math. \nWe spend ____ hours working throughout our life. Would you rather spend those hours performing an activity in which concentration comes effortlessly, or unnaturally? \nAnything else was to trudge through endless distraction, relying on tricks like Pomodoro as a crutch. \nFinally, I understood what it meant to know thyself. We have spent hours listening to our partners or our friends, being active listeners, learning their quirks and preferences. \nBut we never perform this act with ourselves? \nKnow thyself. The week after doing this I went to work and realised I preferred sitting facing \nThis level of self-attentativeness and consideration is something I would do for an other (link to notice) - but I would never afford my self. All the sudden I felt guilty - like I had neglected them for so long. \nI felt bad for my self - that I hadn’t listened to them, for my whole life\nNot because it’s accurate, but only because it provides such a crystal clear analogy. Your goal is literally to go for a walk and not be sentient. \nMaybe you will get good at stressing only about the immediate next thing\nThick desires:\n\n\nMetamorphasis \n\n\nCommunity\n\n\nAnd some other small revelation that would have been a cool heading. A thick desire - something that went along with the kangaroo. Craft? I don’t want XYZ, I want to BE. !! Argh what was it. It was while I was cleaning my room. \n\n\nYou’d be surprised at how deeply confrontational this act may become.\n\nInversion of desire\n\nCompanionship is a default human desire\nBut by making this distinction you may realise that you actually desire self-fulfillment, or colloquially, just having your own stuff together, more than you desire having a certain someone else in your life. You actually desire to be alone\nThis is an example of an inversion.\n 2. Unwrapping of desire\nAnother revelation may come in the form of a truefication of a desire - that is, the discovery of a truly thick desire that has been thinly wrapped in a thin desire. An example may be thinking you want to start a company because of money, status, and financial independence. But I realised I honestly just want community and to build my own team. \n\n\nCraftsman ship. \n\n\nGood for saving money: thick desires don’t die out\nA thick desire must be by definition something you can change\nEmphasis that if you can’t stand the quality of your own thoughts then no one else can. Judgement judgement insecurity worry hatred \nDon’t judge just meditate. Doing that one hour meditation I realised how fucking much of a birds nest my mind is. I legit can’t stand my own thoughts. \nGod gives you blessings and you must find happiness.\nOne of my issues with the task &quot;embody but try not to think&quot; is that the semantic distinction between thinking and feeling is hard to grasp. If you notice that you feel happy or sad, is that a thought? Or a feeling?\n\nI found animals a useful framework to try to understand the distinction, as they negotiate the world using senses. A bird might fly north because of an environmental cue, but it does not say to itself in words, &quot;I want to fly north.&quot; I came to understand the task not as emptying your head of thoughts, but rather resisting the tendency to narrate things to yourself in words. I noticed that this interior monologuing would lead me along familiar, superficial trains of thought, to recent memories associated with certain\n\nfeelings, say, and soon enough back to mundane\n"},"s/Untitled":{"title":"Untitled","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"s/Weekends-are-for-Building":{"title":"Weekends are for Building","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Introduce the concept of Life Building\nIf I just compulsively sacrifice and Mew and build and build.
