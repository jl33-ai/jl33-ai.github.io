Will&JustinGame.bat was the **first program** I ever wrote, alongside my childhood friend William. See the source code [here](https://github.com/jl33-ai/legacy-projects/blob/main/first-program-ever/Will%26JustinGame.bat)

It was not only the program that was hardcoded with hundreds of `GOTO` and `ECHO`'s, but also the **storyline**.

What if we didn't have to hardcode every possible storyline. 

The idea of completely unlimited, sandbox gameplay has tantalised the imaginations of gamers since the first RPG.

Now, with LLM's, I can fulfill this pipe dream. Let's write it in C++

(Note: we were heavily under the influence of Terraria at the time)
