The ocd within me likes to enumerate.

Since fashion is really all about comparing oneself to others, what better way to do this but quantify one's taste and map it onto 'fashion space'. 

I wanted to display my primitive sense of fashionon my personal blog. 

my attire tends to lie at the edge of clusters. There are two potential explanations: 

1. Artefacts of the photos that are inconsistent with the rest of the dataset (orientation, scaling, luminoscity)
2. I have edgy taste, y'know

it's impossibe to ascertain what these axes actually represent, nor what relative positioning of clusters, nor what relative positioning within clusters represents. 

But, t-SNE is a nonlinear technique that focuses on preserving the pairwise similarities between data points in a lower-dimensional space. t-SNE is concerned with preserving small pairwise distances whereas, PCA focuses on maintaining large pairwise distances to maximize variance.

This lower dimensional space is intangible.
