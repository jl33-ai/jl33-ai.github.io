# Motivation

Every person has, at some point, encountered the challenge of optimally designing their new space.
‍  
I **_really_** love my bedroom. It was my sanctuary during the pandemic. It is where I've had all of my ups and downs. I've always done these outlandish renovations, much to the disappointment of my parents. And now I (kinda) have adult money, so I decided it was time to invest in my setup.

I listen to music when I'm doing long haul work... and I've recently inherited **5 beautiful bookshelf speakers.**   
‍

My natural inspiration: [Dwight's Megadesk]()

So, let's start work on **`MEGADESK V`**

# Heuristic Ensemble Gradient Descent

[Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) algorithms like A* have a component that just goes, *'hm I think we should move a bit in this direction, just cos that's the vibe'*. While they don't guarantee to find the most optimal solution, they tend to be extremely efficient. 

My approach is about as **heuristic** as it gets: *If this layout good, nudge in that direction. If this layout bad, nudge in opposite direction.* 

It is also an 'ensemble' form of gradient descent, because it combines influence from multiple models, thus minimizing variance.
