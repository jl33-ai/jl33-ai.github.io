# pseudotherapy (a proof of concept)

**A side experiment**: The idea was to create a program which served as a note taking platform. As the user populated it with notes, a GPT would be trained on them, a neural network with weights and biases which ultimately mirroring the user's thoughts (`Synap`).

Running inference on `Synap` would generate some obsfucated representation of the user's thoughts, and allow a separate LLM (`Kiara`) to investigate the user's stream of thought and talk about them. My key learning from [[#Comparing w/ finetuning]] was that, even fine tuned on a small model for a couple minutes (on a Mac!) is able to produce results so unsettlingly similar. It's hard to describe; it's like, they're similar enough that you 

For someone who writes, it was one of the most extrinsic experiences I've ever had.

This method targets [exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy](https://www.treatmyocd.com/blog/what-is-memory-hoarding-in-ocd#) - helping the user to confront their own thoughts.

- **Keep in mind** that I only fine tuned a `gpt2-medium` model, for a `few hours`, on a `macbook m2`, and on maybe `40%` of my notes. According to all known laws of model training, this was only the tip of the iceberg. 
	- The model I use frequently (for my own sake) was trained with `x10` the previous volume, as well as fine tuned on `gpt-xl` instead of `gpt-medium`. 

Memory Hoarding OCD, and how I accidentally cloned my consciousness

I am using consciousness as a proxy for 'stream of thought', but according to [solipsism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism), what's the difference? 

‍
What I didn't realize is that my mhocd had provided the rare opportunity to do something most people cannot: it means you have a dataset upon which the majority of your thoughts, ideas, feelings, and life events are transcribed, allowing you to 

Here, the [problem of other minds](). If this 'thinks' and 'speaks' like me - is it me? While I may know that this stream of text is unconscious, how do you know that your friend is conscious? After all, they are just some outward stream of sound and movement.
