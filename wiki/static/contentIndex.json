The body likes equilibrium. It likes rest in exchange for effort. You have to maintain constant upwards pressure. Learn to love this pressure. This pressure is the essence of life itself.\nExpect to see yourself at fucking 5am. Be your own coach.\nYour days should be as idempotent as possible. It sounds boring - it’s the opposite. The struggle to achieve this consistency generates persisting memories and depth of character worth more than anything. Finally, it creates long-term abundance."},"letters/is-there-a-word-for":{"title":"Is there a word for X?","links":["words/sadness"],"tags":[],"content":"A\nThe sadness of knowing you will never get to visit every restaurant in the world, know every person, or walk down every alleyway.\n- Tends to manifest while traveling  e.g. flying past entire villages in a few seconds, and experiencing the sheer magnitude of the world.\nB\nThe longing to live a completely different life — e.g. growing up as a high school student in Japan, 2010."},"words/addiction":{"title":"addiction","links":["/"],"tags":[],"content":"Is addiction zero-sum?\n\nIn this case, if you stop being addicted to something then you will seek it out in equal amounts elsewhere.\nThe net amount of addiction in your body is unchangeable.\nThere’s some stuff out there about why highly addictive people are successful.\nIf addiction is immutable, then success if simply the result of the addictions getting healthier.\nThe same behavioral traits that make them addicts also lead to success.

In the good times, you don’t indulge, you deposit. If you’re happier more than you’re sad, then the well never empties—in fact it should monotonically increase.\n\nThis is the only way to stop your happiness from being hedonic.\nWhy is it so hard to be happy with what we have and got, and then channel that happiness into working towards what you don’t yet have.\nOur blessings include not just what we have but what we got.\nWhat we have is transient, ephemeral, and infinitesimal.\n\nImagine enjoying what you have today versus enjoying what you’ve HAD (a stickman standing compounding giant graph), then on the right, you have the scaries of life.\nWould you rather be standing on a thin column or a big ass bunker of a graph?\nWhy do we party - if not to cultivate a persistent bank of happiness? It can’t be just to enjoy the present moment, just today.\nHow?\n\nWhenever you experience ecstasy, your first job is to feel less.\nIf you can’t compress it, then don’t let it fizzle out! Take a moment, breath it in, and then cup as much of it up as you can and put it in a box.\nThis is the box you keep to get you through the bad times, where you can take things out one by one.\nLife is a sine wave with noise. Hold onto your box\n\nThere are two different modes of experience:\n\nExperience to hoard memories\nExperience to experience\n\n\nWatch Naval’s biggest mistake thing\nCache your happiness desperately. Why desperately? Because happiness actively working against you.\nCaching is a prerequisite to practicing high quality gratitude.\nYou don’t spent all your money as soon you receive it - instead put it in the bank and let it compound.\nInstead of experiencing happiness reactively, we should treat happiness like money and only withdraw it when we need it.\nWhen you feel happiness…\n\nNotice it\nStore it\nCache your happiness\n\nLow-GI happiness\nSlow down your happiness\nAcknowledge when you’re in abundance, and have the proactive discipline not to get ahead of yourself\nTo paraphrase bill gates: success is a lousy teacher. It seduced you into thinking you couldn’t lose \nThe Law of independence (explain via the logo)\nWhen things do, sometimes, go your way. \n\nNot caching the happiness\nBut instead just getting completely and utterly carried away with it, like a fucking tidal wave, losing all remnant or memories of what it felt like to struggle, basically burning the books of that entire religion on your little high. This, conceptually, sounds easy to do - fun, even, expected. Of course when I get what I finally want I’ll pick all the pieces, pull it all togtether, and not drop the ball. Quite the contrary. The clock starts ticking when things start going your way - till when they won’t. The only defense against this is to make the extremely awkward, unnatural and uncomfortable intentional decision to keep and rechannelling that effort. \nThen you crash. And have to experience that and go back to where you started. \n\nNo. When you are blessed with good fortunes. Use it to fuel further discipline\nI’ve never felt such fulfillment. Maybe. It’s the only way to live. \nTend to the garden of things that do not need to be tended to yet.\nBe grossly proactive, be unreasonably overprepared.\nNo matter what. Stay disciplined. \nWhen you get wealthy you reinvest. Don’t spend. So Don’t spend your happiness. - it will pay off and lead to more long term.\nLying to ones self is terrible advice, and should be treated with the same severity as giving someone health advice that will benefit them in the short-term, but be damaging in the longer term. Job hunts are extremely stressful. My father, although an incredibly generous and fair man, knew this secret and that it was necessary to be harsh for our own sakes.\n“You have nothing yet.”\nDo not celebrate. It is the most dangerous thing to do.\nLinks to gratitude. That perfect tension between ‘I have everything’ and ‘I have nothing.’\nSeeing the fruits of success should impel you to go back to that dark place\nGratitude. Pray for more meals. You can always break down things into atomic units. The unit is gratitude. God gives you blessings not happiness.\nOver enough iterations you will start to notice the lifecycle, how effort leads to reward. Hopefully, you will eventually learn to focus on the effort side of the equation, to see reward only as a derivative effort; and thus to focus only on the effort side of the equation, not the reward; go as far as to ignore it completely.\nThere is no reason feeling grateful is one-time use. It should be a repetitive obsession, nay a ritual - for we have more than we had yesterdays? But feel less gratitude? Cache with the simple goal of continuing to feel the same way about it. \nI always like to think of the caveman entering a grocery store. \nWe have to fight the rapid desensitization. \nThe point of this mental ritual is. \nIt is fucking hard. In the face of feast - stay hungry - actually that connotation is too light - be starving.\nReplace the word happy with grateful in your vocabulary at as low a level as you can\nCaching your own happiness makes you less likely to “derive comfort from the misfortunes of others” - this is a knee jerk reaction.\nCommon Pattern:\nif (cache.has(event))\n\treturn cache.get(event)\nresult = ...\ncache.set(result)\nreturn result\n\nMimesis\nIf you are constantly pursuing happiness then you are, by definition, unhappy most of the time. \nAdmitting you don’t know mimesis will lead you down a great adventure.\nBe very selective about what you derive happiness from. Be very intentional about it. Any time you do this, you create a dependency."},"words/hedonic":{"title":"hedonic","links":["words/novelty"],"tags":[],"content":"Describes something which eventually reverts back to the mean.\n\nFor example “happiness is hedonic—once the novelty wears off”\n"},"words/iteration":{"title":"iteration","links":["words/iteration","words/beauty","words/monotonically-increasing","words/refactoring"],"tags":[],"content":"Iteration is such a beautiful concept.\n\nThe idea of repeatedly giving love to the same thing…\nIn such a way as to make it better each time.\nA mechanism through which you can (almost) guarantee to improve something.\nIf I am bored, I will just pick something and iterate on it.
